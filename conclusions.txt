My project taught me about how machine learning does word similarity for its search queries. Whenever I made a query, my results wouldn't show the correct movie until the description thing I wrote matched some words exactly. It was also interestimg seeing how the large amount of data made it so that the more popular movies were buried with random movies where the query was deemed as matching closer with its cosine similarity. I thought adding the genres helped filter further and make the model closer. I felt like this project was good practice for machine learning projects, and I plan to continue improving on the website until the model is working better, and the ui is more consistent.
